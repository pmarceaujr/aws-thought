use the package multer to provide the middleware for handling multipart/form-data,

//With multer we'll create a temporary storage container that will hold the image files 
//until it is ready to be uploaded to the S3 bucket. Under the imported constants that we just created, add the following statement:
const storage = multer.memoryStorage({
    destination: function (req, file, callback) {
        callback(null, '');
    }
});

//Next we'll declare the upload object, which contains the storage destination and the key, image, using the following expression:
//use the preceding function, upload, to store the image data from the form data received by the POST route. 
//We'll use the single method to define this upload function will only receive one image. We'll also define the key of image object as image.
// image is the key!
const upload = multer({ storage }).single('image');

//instantiate the service object, s3, to communicate with the S3 web service, 
//which will allow us to upload the image to the S3 bucket. See the following code for an example:
//We locked the version number as a precautionary measure in case the default S3 version changes. 
//This way the code we write has a lower chance of breaking due to default version changes to the API
const s3 = new AWS.S3({
    apiVersion: '2006-03-01'
})


//With all the necessary dependencies set up now, create the route in the following statement:
//we retrieved the image file object, req.file, from the route using multer. 
///We assigned the returned object from the paramsConfig function to the params object. 
//Next, use the s3 service interface object we instantiated previously with the aws-sdk package to call the upload() methodâ€”as shown in the following S3 service call:
/*
Similar to the pattern we used previously for the DynamoDB calls, we'll use the callback function to catch any internal 
errors with the web service and log error and success messages accordingly. In the last statement of this route, 
we send the data retrieved from S3 back to the client. The data will contain the image file's metadata, including the URL, 
bucket name, file name, and more. Now that the route is complete, it should look like the following statement:
